# CEHv11 

In the following sections I'll write about all the things as I try to learn all about security. As a starting point, I decided to start from CEHv11 for variety of reasons, some of those are:
- Lots of people think its a good point to start; You know, consensus!
- I've already some knowledge about security and hacking.
- I've some valuable learning content regarding CEH.
- Lots of other reasons.

As you may already know CEHv11 is devided into 20 different modules. I'll write up about each module as I study around it. But also I decided to have differenet sections for important tools like nmap, as such tools are invaluable and can be used on different phases. 
So, lets get started!


## Modules Overall Picture
As I'm interested in Mindmaps, the first draft version of CEHv11 would be something like this.

## Interesting Tools
There are so many tools as you go on through the course of learning of security, but some of them are so useful and constantly being mentioned. So, these tools worth seperate sections 
- [nmap](https://github.com/gh0ghnu3/CEHv11/blob/main/nmap.md)
- [massscan](https://#)
- [metasploit](https://#)


## Books To Read

Some books can pave the way for your learning toward being a security expert. I try to intrudce some good books here!
