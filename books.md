# Books To Read

Some books can pave the way for your learning toward being a security expert. I try to intrudce some good books here!
- [The Hacker Playbook 3](https://www.amazon.com/Hacker-Playbook-Practical-Penetration-Testing/dp/1980901759) You should really read this book, and take it seriously. Tremendous book! You'll find many topics in this book that other security books mention those as "beyond scope".
- [Nmap Network Exploration and Security Auditing Cookbook: Network discovery and security scanning at your fingertips, 3rd Edition 3rd ed. Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Network-Exploration-Security-Auditing-Cookbook/dp/1838649352/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3FYS5M4PYWB74&keywords=nmap&qid=1643233882&s=books&sprefix=nma%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C756&sr=1-2) Interesting book to learn about nmap and how to use NSE!
